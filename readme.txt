code:
1.Code for data preprocessing 
2. Code for generating the phenotype file
3. Code for difference analysis with limma package
4. Code for GO and KEGG enrichment analysis
5. Code for Visualize 

example:
exprSet.txt = data preprocessing output file
phenotype.csv = generated phenotype file
nrDEG_GSE10500.txt = difference analysis results
GOenrich_GSE10500.txt = GO enrichment analysis results
KEGGenrich_GSE10500.txt = KEGG enrichment analysis results
